# Amaya Shaw | UX/UI Designer & Visual Storyteller
**Designing simple, intuitive digital experiences that drive business results.**

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio, built with **Laravel** and **Tailwind CSS v4**. This site serves as a live demonstration of my ability to bridge the gap between high-level UX research and functional, responsive web development.

## 🎨 The Design Process
For this portfolio, I treated the site as a product for two primary users: **Recruiters** and **Potential Clients**.

### 1. Research & Strategy
I analyzed top-tier design portfolios to identify key friction points. My goal was to create a "frictionless" navigation experience where my work is always one click away.

### 2. Visual Identity
* **Color Palette:** A soothing "Sage Green" theme to evoke growth, balance, and professionalism.
* **Typography:** Using *Instrument Sans* and *Inter* for maximum readability and a modern, high-end editorial feel.
* **Layout:** Clean, minimalist grid structures that prioritize visual hierarchy and white space.

### 3. Implementation
I chose Laravel for its robust routing and templating capabilities, allowing me to manage complex project case studies efficiently.
